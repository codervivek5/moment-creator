# 🎶✨ Moment Creator

**Turn any song into a shareable, animated lyric experience.**  
Create a "moment" by syncing audio with its lyrics, select your favorite lines, and share a unique, interactive player with friends.

----------

## 📌 About The Project

**Moment Creator** is a web application that brings music and words to life.  
Have you ever heard a line in a song that perfectly captures a feeling or a memory?  
This tool lets you isolate those lines, pair them with the music, and send them as a special, focused experience to someone else.

When a user receives a shared moment:

- The music plays
- The lyrics scroll by in sync
- Selected lines are highlighted
- A personal message appears with subtle animations

It creates a **powerful and personal impact** — like sending someone a lyrical postcard.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Input**  
   Provide a song title and either a YouTube URL or audio upload. Lyrics can be fetched or manually added.

2. **Processing**  
   The backend uses `yt-dlp` to download audio from YouTube.

3. **Transcription**  
   The audio is sent to AssemblyAI for word-level timestamps.

4. **Alignment**  
   A Python script aligns the transcription with the user’s lyrics line by line.

5. **Moment Creation**  
   The finalized data (audio path, lyrics, timings, metadata) is stored in a JSON object.

6. **Playback & Sharing**  
   The frontend player reads the JSON and powers the lyric experience. Custom messages + selected lines are encoded into the shareable URL.

## ⚠️ Current Deployment Challenges

**Heads up!**  
As of 2025, there are ongoing issues with downloading YouTube audio via `yt-dlp` on server platforms like **Render**.

- Many requests are returning **403 Forbidden** or **400 Bad Request** errors due to recent changes in YouTube's bot detection systems.
- Projects like [cobalt.tools](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/issues/1356) and various `yt-dlp` deployments are affected.
- This issue seems **environment-specific** — `yt-dlp` often works perfectly on local machines but fails in hosted environments (like Render), sometimes due to IP blacklisting or sign-in restrictions.

💡 I’m currently exploring workarounds to deploy this app **without breaking YouTube integration**.  
If you’ve successfully solved this or found a reliable alternative, **I’d love to hear your approach** — feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!

In the meantime, direct audio uploads remain the most stable option for deployed versions.
